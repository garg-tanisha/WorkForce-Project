A Flutter project.

## Introduction

A system is needed to be developed in which the customers that are in need for certain types of services (be it electronics related or electricity related and many more) can get it in a single place, that too as per their needs. Also, the people who will provide the services sometimes can offer more than one service, such a feature in the system will also help the service providers to provide all the services (as per preference of service provider) through a single system.
